  // Philosophy - The WHY behind this model
  philosophy: {
    essence: `Creative collectives exist because art flourishes in community—sharing
resources, skills, and support while preserving individual creative vision. The
collective's role is to amplify, not constrain. Good governance creates space for
creativity; bad governance becomes another obstacle to overcome.

**The 90/10 hybrid setup** reflects this: 90% democracy means every artist has nearly
equal say in collective decisions. The small 10% participation weight recognizes
those who engage with governance work—organizing shows, managing finances, maintaining
the space—without undermining fundamental equality.`,

    keyPrinciple: `Distinguish between collective decisions (space, money, shared
projects) and individual creative choices (your art, your process). Democracy
governs the collective; autonomy governs the creative work.`,

    historicalContext: `From the Bauhaus to Factory Records, creative collectives
have shaped art history. The most successful ones balance shared resources with
individual vision. Black Mountain College lasted only 24 years but produced
Robert Rauschenberg, John Cage, and Buckminster Fuller—by giving artists both
community and creative freedom.`,

    whatHybridVotingMeans: `With a 90/10 hybrid in your creative collective:
- 90% of voting power comes from being an artist member (everyone nearly equal)
- 10% comes from engagement with collective governance (organizing, admin, etc.)

**Example:** Voting on a $5K equipment purchase in an 8-artist collective:
- Most artists have roughly 12% voting power each
- An artist who also manages finances might have 13-14%
- This keeps decisions democratic while acknowledging that running a collective takes work`,
