  // Philosophy - The WHY behind this model
  philosophy: {
    essence: `Sometimes your organization doesn't fit neatly into existing templates.
Custom governance lets you build exactly what you need. But custom comes with
responsibility: you're making design decisions that will affect how your
community functions for years to come.

**Hybrid voting is the foundation:** you set the balance between democracy (equal voice)
and participation (earned influence). This slider is the most important decision in
custom governance—it determines whether your org leans democratic, meritocratic, or
balanced.`,

    keyPrinciple: `Before going custom, ask: is this truly unique, or am I
reinventing the wheel? Most governance problems have been solved before.
Custom governance should build on proven patterns, not ignore them.`,

    historicalContext: `The history of governance is full of well-intentioned
experiments that failed. Novel designs often look great on paper but struggle
in practice. The most successful custom governance starts with existing
patterns and adapts them thoughtfully.`,

    whatHybridVotingMeans: `Hybrid voting combines two sources of voting power:
- **Democracy weight:** Equal voice for every member (one person, one vote portion)
- **Participation weight:** Influence earned through engagement (contribution-based portion)

**How to set your balance:**
- 100/0 = Pure democracy. Everyone equal regardless of engagement.
- 80/20 = Mostly democratic. Engagement matters a little.
- 50/50 = Balanced. Equal voice and earned influence both matter.
- 30/70 = Meritocratic. Those who contribute most guide decisions.
- 0/100 = Pure meritocracy. Influence only through contribution.

Start with 50/50 if unsure. You can always adjust based on experience.`,
