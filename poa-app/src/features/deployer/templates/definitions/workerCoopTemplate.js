  // Philosophy - The WHY behind this model
  philosophy: {
    essence: `Worker cooperatives give workers ownership and control over their
workplace. Unlike traditional businesses where owners and workers have different
interests, cooperatives align everyone's incentives—when the business succeeds,
everyone benefits.

**Hybrid voting** lets you balance two important values:
- **Democracy** (one person, one vote): Every worker-owner has equal voice
- **Participation** (contribution-based): Those who engage more have earned more influence

An 80/20 split means 80% of voting power comes from equal membership, while 20%
rewards active participation. This isn't anti-democratic—it recognizes that those
who show up consistently have valuable context for decisions.`,

    keyPrinciple: `Start with some participation weight (20-30%) even in a highly
democratic cooperative. This creates healthy incentives for engagement and builds
the "democratic muscle" your organization needs. You can always increase democracy
weight as your culture matures—it's much harder to add structure later.`,

    whatHybridVotingMeans: `When you vote with an 80/20 hybrid system:
- 80% of your voting power comes from being a member (everyone equal)
- 20% comes from your participation tokens (earned through work and engagement)

**Example:** In a 10-person cooperative voting on a $50K equipment purchase:
- With pure democracy, each person has 10% of voting power
- With 80/20 hybrid, a very active member might have 12-13% while a less active member has 8-9%

The active member's voice is stronger, but not dominant. This rewards engagement
without silencing anyone.`,

    historicalContext: `The Mondragon Corporation in Spain—the world's largest worker
cooperative with 80,000+ worker-owners—succeeds because of pragmatic governance
that adapts to scale, not ideological purity. They've learned that pure democracy
works beautifully in small teams but needs structure as organizations grow.`,

engagement—completing tasks, participating in votes, contributing to the
